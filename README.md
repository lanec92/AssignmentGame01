# AssignmentGame01
This the first assignment in the game programming class at NSU. I used the brackeys tutorial to make the base game and then expaned it using other resouces. 
Things to note: The actual project is in the assignment01 folder, the video of me playing the game is in video, and the executable folder contains the executable to run the project if you so wish. 
Controls of the Game: You will use the a key to move left and the d key to move right. To bring up the pause menu you will have to hit the escape key. If you are having trouble bringing the menu up you may need to left click on the screen on level one then hit the escape key. If you think the music is too loud then hit escape then options, then drag the slider to adjust the volume.
Final words: I hope you enjoy the game and I look forward to hearing how I can improve the game and over all develoment.
